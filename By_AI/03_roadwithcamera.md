First-person perspective of a hand holding an old-model mobile phone horizontally, actively taking a photo. 
The phone's screen displays a view mirroring the scene in front of it: a long, straight, empty concrete path or road stretching into the distance under a dusky or twilight sky with a hint of orange and pink on the horizon. 
Above the path, a modern concrete bridge or overpass with railings spans across the scene. 
The overall lighting is dim and atmospheric, with cool blue and purple tones dominating the sky and ground, and the scene captured by the phone's camera
