A stunning panoramic cityscape at dusk or early night, featuring a prominent, brightly lit Ferris wheel with glowing yellow and pink lights in the foreground, situated near a body of water (like a bay or harbor). 
Behind the Ferris wheel, a dense cluster of modern skyscrapers rises, with many windows lit up, reflecting the twilight sky and creating a vibrant urban glow. 
The sky is a deep, rich blue, characteristic of the 'blue hour.' 
The scene captures a bustling waterfront area with subtle details of piers or waterfront structures. 
The overall mood is dynamic and architectural, showcasing a vibrant city after sunset
