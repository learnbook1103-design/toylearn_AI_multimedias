"A male musician with long dark hair tied back, a full beard, and wearing a black t-shirt, dark pants, and bright yellow-framed sunglasses. 
He is actively playing a uniquely shaped, wooden electric bass guitar with gold hardware and intricate inlays on the fretboard. 
He is standing outdoors in a dry, grassy, golden-hued field or hillside under a clear, bright blue sky. 
The lighting is natural and bright, highlighting the musician and his instrument. The overall feeling is that of a live performance or practice session in a natural, open environment.
