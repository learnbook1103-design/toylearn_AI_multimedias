```
Brown hills in the background, out of focus
On the left side of the background, a slender man with long hair tied back holds a brown electric guitar.
He wears yellow horn-rimmed glasses, a beard and mustache connecting to his sideburns,
a black short-sleeved T-shirt, and a black beaded necklace around his neck.
His left hand holds the guitar strings while his right hand plucks them.
His body faces forward,
but his head is turned to the right side of the screen, looking at the guitar.
Inside his left elbow is a lettering tattoo.
