A semicircular lake on the left, snow-capped mountains in the distance, savanna backdrop,

[one fish eagle, one giraffe] positioned in the middle ground, one lioness lying prone at the bottom with her back muscles emphasized, gazing at the lake, On the right, a large malachite kingfisher perches on a branch in the lower right corner, a spotted hyena prowls in the center right, and a herd of elephants charges toward the viewer. In the distance, a herd of wildebeest faintly crosses the scene. A weaver bird sits atop an acacia tree, and acacia trees are scattered throughout the grassland. Two termite mounds are visible in the center-left. 

Around the lake, [two kudu, one impala, two Butchell's zebra, one black rhino, two Thomson's gazelle] leisurely drink from the lake water. Three hippopotamus have only their heads above the water, and one hammerkop perches on a hippo's back. Two white-faced ducks swim on the lake.
