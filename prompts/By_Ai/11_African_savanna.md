A highly detailed, photorealistic image of a vibrant savanna habitat. In the foreground, a majestic lion rests on a grassy bank near a clear lake. A malachite kingfisher with brilliant blue and orange plumage perches on a branch to the right. In the lake, white-faced ducks swim peacefully, and a hippopotamus is submerged with a hammerkop bird standing on its back. Kudu, impala, Burchell's zebra, a black rhino, and Thomson's gazelles are drinking water from the lake. In the middle ground, a group of elephants is gathered, and wildebeest, giraffes, and spotted hyenas roam across the savanna. Several acacia trees with weaver bird nests hang from their branches are scattered across the landscape. Termite mounds are visible. A fish eagle soars high in the blue sky. The scene is bathed in natural, warm light, capturing the rich textures of the animals' fur and skin, the glistening water, and the detailed foliage. Wide angle shot
